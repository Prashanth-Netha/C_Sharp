Delegates are known as function pointer used to call function either one at a time or a sequential method

* Delegates should have same return type of which it is calling.

Single-cast Delegate
A single-cast delegate is a delegate that references a single method. When the delegate is invoked, it calls the single method it references.


Multicast Delegate
A multicast delegate is a delegate that references multiple methods. When the delegate is invoked, it calls each method in its invocation list, 
in the order they were added. Multicast delegates are created by combining multiple delegates using the + operator or the += operator, and they can be removed using the - operator or the -= operator.

Single-cast delegates: Reference a single method.
Multicast delegates: Reference multiple methods and invoke them in sequence.
Adding Methods: Use the + or += operator to add methods to a multicast delegate.
Removing Methods: Use the - or -= operator to remove methods from a multicast delegate.
Invocation Order: Methods are invoked in the order they were added.
